Superfish Install Guide

This guide operates under the assumption that you're using an Adaptive Theme.

Superfish should already be installed as part of your install profile, if not install Superfish.
Access structure->blocks, place the superfish 1 block into the Main Menu Bar region.
Configure the block, change styling to "None".
Save everything.
Profit!
